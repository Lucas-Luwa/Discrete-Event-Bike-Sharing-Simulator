# Discrete-Event-Bike-Sharing-Simulator
CX 4230 (Computer Simulation) Final Project 

Task 1: Create a simulator & Task 2: A baseline experiment
- Project3T1+2.py: This file contains the simulation and also outputs the waiting time along with percentage of bikers served when run. This was used to generate the first part of the Data.txt file.

Task 3: An “idealized” experiment
- Project3T3.py: This program outputs a list of the minimum number of bikes to serve all people at any given time. It takes the maximum value of this list and adds it to the Data.txt file for evaluation.

dataStorage.py: This file holds the probabilities of the stations in a 1D and 2D array format, which is generated from the provided data. Additionally, the data processor is located in the "Data Parser" folder.
